def tree(X, n, symbolic=False):
    '''Evaluates the entire tree of orthogonal polynomials for the n-cube

    The computation is organized such that tree returns a list of arrays, L={0,
    ..., dim}, where each level corresponds to the polynomial degree L.
    Further, each level is organized like a discrete (dim-1)-dimensional
    simplex. Let's demonstrate this for 3D:

    L = 1:
         (0, 0, 0)

    L = 2:
         (1, 0, 0)
         (0, 1, 0) (0, 0, 1)

    L = 3:
         (2, 0, 0)
         (1, 1, 0) (1, 0, 1)
         (0, 2, 0) (0, 1, 1) (0, 0, 2)

    The main insight here that makes computation for n dimensions easy is that
    the next level is composed by:

       * Taking the whole previous level and adding +1 to the first entry.
       * Taking the last row of the previous level and adding +1 to the second
         entry.
       * Taking the last entry of the last row of the previous and adding +1 to
         the third entry.

    In the same manner this can be repeated for `dim` dimensions.
