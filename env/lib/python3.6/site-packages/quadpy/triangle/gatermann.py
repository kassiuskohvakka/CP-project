    Abstract:
    The weights and nodes of a symmetric cubature formula are determined by
    solving a system of nonlinear equations. The number of equations and their
    structure are investigated for symmetric cubature formulas for the square
    and the triangle. A new cubature formula of degree 7 with 12 nodes is given
    for the triangle.
